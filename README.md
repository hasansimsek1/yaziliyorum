I am teaching myself with [this blog](www.yaziliyorum.com) like thing..

It is almost an obligation to write what you learn in software development carier. It presents who you are and how you do things. Besides that you learn while you are writing..


## Blog Structure
When I first thought about this blog, I had been in an uncertain mind about writing a blog or tutorial like thing. But I decided to write my own way of thinking and this project took place between blog and tutorial. I call this project as 'opinionated blog'. In this blog I would like to blend my own opinions and the facts about that topic together. Anyway, I hope I can contribute to public knowledge via this 'opinionated blog'.

While I was planning the structure of this blog, I came across to one thing. You should not separate computer fields in your mind like hardware, network, OSs and software, if you want to do the software development job well. Because my expreiences taught me that the more you know about other fields, the more you are comfortable and flexible in software development work.

So the 'curriculum' goes like that :

## About This Project
For now, I keep this blog only on front-end tier. I write my articles directly in the HTML code. Maybe in a later time, I build a backend for it. I use React and its friends (redux, router etc..) for this project.
